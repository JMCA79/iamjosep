  <section id="about" class="about">
    <p>My name is Josep, I'm a Web designer & Front Development from Barcelona, Spain. Formed in 1999 at IDEP School of Design & Multimedia, I studied forms of solving complex problems and turning them into simple and usable interface designs.</p> 
    <p>I also like the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write correct and efficient code, whether it be HTML, CSS or Javascript. My primary role as a Web designer is one of easing the flow of communication. With a background in graphic design and art direction, as well as extensive experience of working within interactive design, I handle work across a broad range of media.</p>
